# GridDragDropApp

This is a simple example of how to move controls on a grid control in a Windows Forms Application. 

The aim is to create a premier data capture and data output processing suite that's modern, attractive visually and operably, and easy to use for any business use case.

The possibilities of adding on to this Windows Forms .NET Desktop Application are endless.
